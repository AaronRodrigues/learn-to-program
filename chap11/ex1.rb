# Safer picture downloading. Adapt the picture-downloading/file-renaming
# program to your computer by adding some safety features to make sure
# you never overwrite a file. A few methods you might find useful are
# File.exist? (pass it a filename, and it will return true or false) and exit (like if
# return and Napoleon had a babyâ€”it kills your program right where it stands;
# this is good for spitting out an error message and then quitting).
